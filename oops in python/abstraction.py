# 1. What is Abstraction?
# Definition: Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details and showing only the essential features.
# It focuses on what an object does, not how it does it.
# ðŸ‘‰ Example in real life: When you drive a car, you use the steering wheel, accelerator, brake.
# You donâ€™t need to know how the engine works internally.
# The car maker hides complexity and only exposes necessary features. # Thatâ€™s abstraction.
# 2. How Python Supports Abstraction?
# Python doesnâ€™t have true abstraction like Java or C++, but it uses Abstract Base Classes (ABC).
# Abstract Base Classes let you create blueprints where child classes must implement certain methods.
# ðŸ‘‰ We use the abc module: # from abc import ABC, abstractmethod


# 3. Abstract Class Rules
# Abstract class = class that cannot be instantiated (canâ€™t create objects directly).
# Must inherit from ABC (class MyClass(ABC):).
# Can have abstract methods (must be implemented in child) and normal methods.
# Any class that inherits must provide implementation for all abstract methods, otherwise Python throws an error.
